DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.16081.63849 

#### *Note: It works on R version 3.3 and 3.6 .* You will need to compile the packages/libraries that are used in [R script]( https://github.com/alikhuseynov/registSurAuto3d/blob/master/pipeline_example.R)

This pipeline is using existing (slightly modified) functions from differnt R packages such as [ANTsR](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTsR), [mesheR](https://github.com/zarquon42b/mesheR), [Arothron](https://github.com/Arothron/Arothron)
Special Thanks to [Stefan Schlager](https://github.com/zarquon42b) for developing lots of great tools!
